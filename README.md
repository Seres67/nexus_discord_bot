## Prerequisites

- Rust (https://rustup.rs/), if building from source.

## How to run

Create a file named `.env` at the root of this project with this content:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=put your token here
```
then either run `cargo run --release` to build and run the bot from source or, download the [latest release](https://github.com/Seres67/nexus_discord_bot/releases).

## Example output
```
crash happened at: "E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Guild Wars 2\Gw2-64.exe :0+xF83344" thread 2088

gw2-64

This is most likely a game crash, and there is nothing we can do about it.
